# Assignment-2-Lottery-Scheduling
This programming assignment will complete the lottery scheduling algorithm in Python using First Come First Served. Because we are utilizing FCFS, we will notice that process 1 will always win of the 3 processes coded into the program no matter the amount of tickets they have as the first one to put in tickets will be the first out (to win).
